2021 came and went really quickly, and now it's 2022.
For me, lots of things happened but nothing too special. I suppose that's a good thing?

That virus starting with 'C' really messed with people in 2020 and 2021.
I was not as severely affected by it as were others, but it could have been worse.
Let's hope it fades away into history for good in 2022.

This year I plan on continuing to work on some open source projects in my free time.
I also have some ambitious projects that are very slowly being materialized on my disk.
If I ever complete them, I may publish them as open source.

Happy new year!
