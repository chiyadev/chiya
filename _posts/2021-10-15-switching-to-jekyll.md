_First post!_

Today I updated [chiya.dev][1] to be completely static.
It is now serving simple, plain HTML web pages generated using [Jekyll][3].

Before this change, I was running a custom React website that presented a responsive landing page with some social links.
It was unnecessarily slow and Javascript-heavy for a landing page.

Jekyll is customizable and has a wide range of themes, so it was an easy choice for a quick and simple website like this one.
This website is running a slightly customized [Hyde][2] theme.
Plus, built-in support for blogging is pretty nice.

Now that I have a blog, I will occasionally post here if I feel like writing stuff.
